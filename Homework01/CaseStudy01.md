It is operational in 16 sender countries and over 50 transfer countries and has strength in sending money to underveloped countries like Central and South America.

* **The Customer** - Mirgrant workers, immigrants, permanent residents and their families all over the world.  They have served the needs of more than 2 million customers and are estimated to have $6B in annual remittance volume.

* **The Market** - Many data points to explosive global growth of FinTech estiated to grow to $305B by 2023, which would pin the CAGR at of 22.17% between 2018-2023.  Of all the segments the payment/billing segment is expected to drive a major share of global growth contributing $207B by 2023 - this information is sourced from MoneyControl.

**Competative Advantages** - Highly competative landscape with in the payments/billing sector, with speed of access to money and cost are major drivers to gain market share of which Remitly has some advantages and still emerging opportunities.  There are many sites that speak to these with a few highlights rating/evaluating the company.

Generally they have very positive reviews sited by Transumo.com they have over 20,000 reviews with an 86% of customers having an excellent experience and 6% having a good experience, so they are addressing and meeting/exceeding market/consumer expectationgs for using their service.

* **Pros for Remitly**

    1. Ease of use.
    2. Multiple payment options.
    3. Protect/Lock exhange rates.
    4. Choice of Delivery options.
        * Express - instant transfers
        * Exonomy - one to four business days
    5. Communication of Transfer Updates via text

* **Opportunities for Growth/Improvement**

    1. High costs - fees can quickly stack making is costly to send money - people looking to save money may lean to using services like TransferWise who is also favorably rated if speed isn't a concern.
    2. Transfer limits - this may shrink overall market opportunity for small business or those wanting to send larger amounts of money.
    3. Limited Network
    4. Additional Service - Bill payments and phone reloads as examples
    5. Mobile Customer Engagement strategy - looking at a competitor Xoom (PayPal) is a clear leader in this space as two-thirds of there app downloads were from referrals vs. 9.4% for Remitly

* **Technology**

According to G2 STack and StackShare, Remitly is leveraging 73 technolody products including, but not limited to HTML 5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, React, Bootstrap, Google Cloud Platform, GitHub Pages, Amazon SES, SquareSpace, Java, Amazon CloudFront.  Additionally, they are using a further 53 technologies for it's website cited by BuiltWith that include Viewport, Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible and LetsEncrypt.  Relating to Business Tools they leverage items such as Gmail, G Suite, Typekit, AdRoll and Olark among others.

Secure Transfers - they use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) with 256-bit encription - this is the industry standard in secure server.  Additionally, passwards and email varification complete the security process - they also make it easy for customers to report suspicious activity via their propietary tools.


## Landscape:

* **Competative Domain:** Payments/Billing

* **FinTech disruption for international Paymnets/Transfer sector:**  At a foundational level they have lowered the barriers and costs for people who want to transfer money overseas.

    1. **Decreasing dependency on banks** - banks are still involved, but there is movement away from banks to more specialized money transfer companies

    2. **Improving Exchange Rates** - the major banks typically held control of the best rates making it hard for mid to small companies match given lack of access.  FinTech companies are highly competitive driving down expenses.

    3. **Lower Transfer Fees** - This is a big disrupter to the transfer industry as most FinTech entrants charge little to no fees depeding on some minimum transfer dollar requirement.  This is also a major driver of lower costs - while banks continue to charge outdated fees.

    4. **Speed** - While banks make take one to four business days, FinTech has leverage the 'Tech'to increase the processing speed of transfers so the money gets to people who need it faster.

    5. **Multiple Payment Options** - Choice is truly an option.  While a bank transfer is the lowest cost option, but other options available to customers now include but not limited to - Google Pay, Apple Pay, Debit Cards, Credit Cards, SOFORT, and others.  Again, while choice is good there are still potentially higher costs to choosing alternative methods of payment.

    6. **Transfer options** - point of sale choices exist now more than ever due to FinTech.  The customers can traansfer over the phone, online, or even in person - in short the access has been simplified.

    7. **Increased pick up options** - this is probably the slower fix given the inroads that Western Union and MoneyGram in global locations for cash pick up.  While getting physical cash feels like a small opportunity some examples of FinTeck companies expanding in this space include, but not limited to Azimo, WorldRemit and Ria.

    8. **Financial Tools** - Not only can customers now potentially schedule regular transfers, there are some companies in the FinTech domain, like World First, OFX and Currencies Direct that provide hedging tools to customers.

    9. **Multicurrency Accounts** - It's all about lower costs.  With disruption small to mid-size companies and now have multicurrency accounts - the win here is you can recieve payments in matching currencies and not have to worry about current moving exchange rates.

    10. **Big Data** - Beyond cost savings, FinTech firms can leverage consumer data/trends and provide enhanced security from cyber criminals.  Trust/safety is a key consumer value that is important to have when dealing with money tranfers, let alone how to leverage data allowing companies to learn more about how and why people send money to build out tools and choice to better serve there needs long term.

* **Competitive Landscape** - closest competition WorldRemit and Western Union

    * **Xoom** - Founded in 2001, Headquarter in San Francisco, Private, Revenue (est) 2012 - $159M

## Results

* **Success Metrics**

    * Valuation
    * Annual Revenue
    * Active Customers
    * Market Size
    * Transaction Volume
    * Employee Rating

* **Remitly Performance Among Close Competition**

    * **Valuation** - currently valued at $1.5B - given that most of the companies are private, they would be mid to low in this category, it has fallen from the Forbes Top 50 Fintech Comanies in 2020 after being on this list in 2019.

        * **Comparisons** - hard to fully judge, Remitly was founded in 2011 of companies founded in similar times TransferWise is higher and on par with WorldRemit.  Obvioulsy these companies have seen agressive growht, but Western Union $9.8B one of the giants PayPal $320B have shown strength.  While the prior may be seen as a brick and morter business, FinTech could still give it long term advantages given footpringts.

    * **Annual Revenue** - lastest reaported revenue is $80M in 2018 - for similar timing of companies again trailing TransferWise and on par with WorldRemit.

    * **Active Customers** - estimated at 1M, there is not a lot of data here with the exception of TransferWise showing an estimate of 8M customers.

    * **Maret Size** - they are operating in 17 markets for sending money, this is where they have a lot of room to grow as this is one theme of weekness, the only other marker found was PayPal showing 200 - since Xoom is a subsidery of PayPal they have a definate advantage here, but this is also a big opportunity for growth.

    * **Transaction Volume** - While there are many sources quoting $6B in remittances, there is a figure of volume, I would assume based on there constraint around transfer amounts that they would be on par with WorldRemit at 5.4M transactions cited in 2016 on Craft.

    * **Employee Rating** - I wouldn't call this a direct factor in finacial success, but it goes a long way to attracting top talent - they have along with TransferWise the highest among direct commpetition that I researched.  This positions them well for growth in key opportunity areas that many ratings call out.


## Recommendations

* **Overview** - Remitly is seen in high regard across the money transfer segment and by most accounts owns a great customer experience, they has a hich ease of use and speed - which is clearly a competative advanage with their two product offering of Express for real time transfers and Economy.  

* **Advice** - I think there are two very clear opportunities that I would call low hanging fruit.  

    1. **Increase Transfer Limits** - this would allow them to potentially touch a new segment in the small business and take more market share.  They already have potential best in class speed and service, why not open this to new markets.

        * **FinTech needed** - This would leverage the current platform and just increase limits to broaden the market - they are also again using industry leading security and encription protocals so a very natural fit for leveling up to small business and just larger transfers in general - this may also help with the perception of there fees being higher than industry trends - given this feels more like a commodity market transparent pricing is key and customers will only pay so much before they will look elsewhere.

    2. **Expand Offerings to include Payments** - again a natural evolution to allow customers to make payments as well as 're-load' their phones.  This seems to be a clear missing offering for a company in this space.  This type of offering would make the company more sticky - thinking of this as a vertical stack, not only do they have the customer transfers, they now allow them to make payments and 're-load' their phones.  As with the first options, this also could open them to new customers as well as small business that are using other services that don't offer these features.

        * **FinTech needed** - This one isn't as straight forward as the intial idea as new tech is needed.  My recommendation is to develope of a master interface and leverage existing best in class payment software like Zelle to quickly capitalize on this opportunity.  I think this is a perfect plug and play option to bolt on to there easy to use fast interface.  Creating a proprietary system not only would take time, but could be very costly.  It is much more cost effective to own the integration and focus on that speed of execution with your existing platform and you are able to capture market share earlier.

    3. **Rapid Expansion** - They are seen as high priced with limited network, also the referrel stats for downloading are also below makret average.  Why these are not linked, again you have an obvious bottleneck that can be addressed and fixed.  I have no doubt this is on there radar, but the trick is can they leverage technology to make this happen sooner.  I would not call them a market leader in growth as other FinTech companies are growing faster so that must be addressed.  This isn't just about more markets it's about addressing holes in the model - you can't transfer between sender countries, can't cover business expense, can't send monitary gifts to charities, can't transfer below $100, and you transfer in a major vs. local country it may also not be idea.

        * **FinTech needed** - Here the conlcusion may be more about access potentially to transfer options and not just merely more markets, so they may have to explore and expand offerings and open up some current barriers based on the business decisions. The tech again here is leveraging there mobile platform and making tweaks to policy to free up revenue streams - this is appropriate as you have an existing customer based with 92% either citing and excellent or good experience. The other tech being leverage is access points in under developed countries.  I think you can still focus on the mission and increase revenue streams in a socially responsible way.

# Conclusion

This is fastly beomcing a crowded space with lots of competition vying for the fastest and most cost affective way to disrupt the market.  Remitly is very well positioned today with high ratings across multiple reviews citing ease of use and speed as key competative advantages.  Fame is fleeting and expansion is key.  There are key open opportunities to leverage thier proprietary tech stach to take this advantage to more people.  The concern may ultimately come from institutinoal banks, while they may be slower to react, they are all betting in FinTech, and they have captial.  Additionally, larger FinTech companies like PayPal have subsidiaries like Xoom already in this space with potentially better tools and market awareness.  Remitly has an opportunity to grow taking advantage of what I feel help plug holes in weeknesses, now it's about speed and exection.
