## Landscape:

* **Competative Domain:** Payments/Billing

* **FinTech disruption for international Paymnets/Transfer sector:**  At a foundational level they have lowered the barriers and costs for people who want to transfer money overseas.

    1. **Decreasing dependency on banks** - banks are still involved, but there is movement away from banks to more specialized money transfer companies

    2. **Improving Exchange Rates** - the major banks typically held control of the best rates making it hard for mid to small companies match given lack of access.  FinTech companies are highly competitive driving down expenses.

    3. **Lower Transfer Fees** - This is a big disrupter to the transfer industry as most FinTech entrants charge little to no fees depeding on some minimum transfer dollar requirement.  This is also a major driver of lower costs - while banks continue to charge outdated fees.

    4. **Speed** - While banks make take one to four business days, FinTech has leverage the 'Tech'to increase the processing speed of transfers so the money gets to people who need it faster.

    5. **Multiple Payment Options** - Choice is truly an option.  While a bank transfer is the lowest cost option, but other options available to customers now include but not limited to - Google Pay, Apple Pay, Debit Cards, Credit Cards, SOFORT, and others.  Again, while choice is good there are still potentially higher costs to choosing alternative methods of payment.

    6. **Transfer options** - point of sale choices exist now more than ever due to FinTech.  The customers can traansfer over the phone, online, or even in person - in short the access has been simplified.

    7. **Increased pick up options** - this is probably the slower fix given the inroads that Western Union and MoneyGram in global locations for cash pick up.  While getting physical cash feels like a small opportunity some examples of FinTeck companies expanding in this space include, but not limited to Azimo, WorldRemit and Ria.

    8. **Financial Tools** - Not only can customers now potentially schedule regular transfers, there are some companies in the FinTech domain, like World First, OFX and Currencies Direct that provide hedging tools to customers.

    9. **Multicurrency Accounts** - It's all about lower costs.  With disruption small to mid-size companies and now have multicurrency accounts - the win here is you can recieve payments in matching currencies and not have to worry about current moving exchange rates.

    10. **Big Data** - Beyond cost savings, FinTech firms can leverage consumer data/trends and provide enhanced security from cyber criminals.  Trust/safety is a key consumer value that is important to have when dealing with money tranfers, let alone how to leverage data allowing companies to learn more about how and why people send money to build out tools and choice to better serve there needs long term.
